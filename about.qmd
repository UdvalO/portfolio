Thank you for taking the time and showing curiosity to check out my portfolio. Here, you will find the projects I have completed since starting my study in April 2024. I will continue to update this portfolio with new projects. I am also open to collaborating on new projectsâ€”if you have a dataset and would like insights, feel free to reach out. Throughout my studies, I have different focus areas each semester:

**Semester 1:** R, PowerBI, SQL, and Data Analysis

**Semester 2:** Python, Tableau, ML, Statistics, & Business Analytics

**Semester 3:** Marketing Analytics, A/B Testing, AI, & ML in Finance

**Semester 4:** Currently, I am on the hunt for a research idea

#### Outside this portfolio

I hold a MSc in Sustainable Transport Degree from University of Leeds. I have published five articles, done podcast interviews and created and presented a video on public space at the UN Ministerial Summit in 2018.

I love cooking and eating good food, so during COVID I started my own channel for cooking.
