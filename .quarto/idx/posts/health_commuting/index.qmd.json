While longer commutes are associated with a slight increase in sick days (2.7 additional days for every 17 km), this effect is statistically insignificant. Age is positively correlated with both more sick days (7.4 additional days for every 11 years older) and poorer self-reported health, with a stronger impact on health status. Higher income is associated with fewer sick days and better self-reported health. Full-time employment is associated with a significant increase in sick days (1.49 more days). Additionally, there is a noticeable trend of rising sick days over time.\n\n\n# Introduction\nAround the world, researchers are confirming that the negative effects of long commutes are linked to poorer health, increased absenteeism from work due to illness, and higher inactivity, which can lead to obesity and other health issues (@gimenez-nadal_commuting_2022, @raza_commuting_2021, @guo_commuting_2020). Two empirical studies in Germany using SOEP data have formally tested the relationship between commuting and sickness absence (@goerke_commuting_2017; @ommeren_are_2011), and their conclusions differ. While the former study identifies a positive correlation between commuting distance and sickness absence in Germany, the latter finds no such relationship. However, they observed that employees who commute long distances are absent approximately 20% more often than those who commute up to 10 km.\n\n\n## This Project \nIn this project, I aim to study the relationship between Health and Commute using the [German Socio-Economic Panel Survey](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.412809.de/sozio-oekonomisches_panel__soep.html) (SOEP). The SOEP is a comprehensive longitudinal survey conducted annually that has been running since 1984, focusing on the socio-economic conditions of households in Germany. Each year, the survey collects data from approximately 30,000 individuals in around 15,000 households  using mixed-mode design, including face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, online surveys, and paper-based interviews. The data collection process is designed to ensure the survey's longitudinal nature, allowing for the observation of social and economic changes over time. The access to the data is restricted to researchers for scientific purposes or for teaching purposes. Strict confidentiality measures are in place, including compliance with German data protection laws, prohibiting data sharing with third parties and ensuring secure storage.\n\n![Fig 1. SOEP Topics](soep.jpg)\n\n## Study Hyphothesis and Questions\nThe literature review indicates that a longer commute distance is associated with a higher number of reported sick days. Based on this evidence, the study employs the following hypotheses:\n\n**Null Hypothesis:** There is no relationship between commute distance and the number of days off from work due to sickness.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis:** A longer commute distance is associated with a higher number of days off from work due to sickness.\n\nFurthermore the study questions are driven as follows:\n\n- How do commuting characteristics, such as distance and time, impact various health outcomes, including sick days and current health status?\n- How does this impact vary across different demographic groups, such as age and gender, or according to various economic factors, such as income and employment status?\n\n## Methodology\nThis study builds on the work of @goerke_commuting_2017, who conducted a comprehensive analysis using SOEP data from the years 2003 to 2011. In their research, focused on commuting distance and sickness absence as key variables, while also considering personal characteristics and job-related indicators. Their analysis employed various econometric models, including Negative Binomial Regression and Fixed-Effects Least Squares Models.\n\nAlthough this study will not delve into as much detail as the aforementioned research, it will extend the analysis of the relationship between commuting distance and sickness absence using data from five years (2015 to 2019) through Mixed Effects Model Analysis. Additionally, the study will examine various demographic and economic indicators, including age, gender, income, and employment status.\n\nThe analysis consists of two parts. Descriptive analysis offer a snapshot of the data, providing a summary of its main variables. In contrast, mixed effects analysis delivers a deeper understanding by estimating the effects of predictors while accounting for random variability. This approach leads to more nuanced conclusions about the relationships within the data, which are crucial for decision-making and hypothesis testing.\n\n$$\n  y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{ij1} + \\beta_2 x_{ij2} + \\ldots + \\beta_p x_{ijp} + u_{0j} + \\epsilon_{ij}\n  $$\n\nDue to inconsistencies in the data, such as missing commute distance information for 2016 and 2018, the chosen model is well-suited for handling unequally spaced time points, time invariant and missing data. To avoid the influence of COVID-19, the year 2020 will not be included in the analysis, even though data for that year is available.\n\n# Data \n\n## Data Preparation\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### General\n\nI began by extracting data from a comprehensive dataset, focusing on variables pertinent to the study. Initially, 13 variables were identified using the Code Book (@bartels_soep-core_2023) and imported from a large dataset. The data was then filtered to include only individuals within the economically active age group (18-65) and for the years relevant to the study. The SOEP survey dataset includes negative codes to denote labels where data is unavailable, irrelevant, or not applicable for certain periods. To facilitate accurate analysis in R, these negative coded labels are converted to NA to represent missing data.\n\n```{r importing data, results='hide', echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/udwal/Documents/Studies_Viadrina/Becoming Data Fluent/Fluent2024/Final Project\")\n\n# Getting individual data from pl\nsoep_df <- read_dta(\"pl.dta\", \n                          col_select = c(syear, ple0055, ple0046, ple0008, ple0072, plb0158, plb0592, pid, plb0471_h, plb0031_h, plb0022_h))\n\n# Getting the individual data from pequiv that were not in pl\ndata_pequiv <- read_dta(\"pequiv.dta\", \n         col_select = c(pid, syear, d11101, d11102ll))\n\n# Joining the two dataset\ncombined_df <- soep_df %>%\n  full_join(data_pequiv, by = c(\"pid\", \"syear\"))\n\n# Converting negative labels into NA as preparation of data\ncombined_df[combined_df < 0] <- NA\n\n# Renaming columns for ease of use\ncombined_df <- combined_df %>%\n  rename(\n    hospital_stays = ple0055,\n    sick_days_LY = ple0046,\n    health_state = ple0008,\n    doctor_visit_L3 = ple0072,\n    commute_km = plb0158,\n    commute_min = plb0592,\n    gender = d11102ll,\n    age = d11101,\n    income = plb0471_h,\n    job_change = plb0031_h,\n    employment_status = plb0022_h)\n\n# Filtering out the years only relevant to the research questions\ncombined_df <- combined_df %>%\n  filter(age >= 18 & age <= 65, syear >= 2015 & syear <= 2020)\n\n# sick days are recorded for the previous year, hence shifting the values to the previous year so the relationship with other variables can be analyzed without lag in the data.\ncombined_df <- combined_df %>%\n  mutate(syear = as.numeric(syear)) %>%\n  mutate(sick_days_LY = as.numeric(sick_days_LY)) %>%\n  group_by(pid) %>%\n  arrange(pid, syear) %>%\n  # Create the previous year variable\n  mutate(sick_days_PY = dplyr::lead(sick_days_LY, n = 1)) %>%\n  # Fill NA values with the most recent non-NA value\n  fill(sick_days_PY, .direction = \"up\") %>%\n  # Ungroup\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # 2020 was pulled only for the reason to get 2019 sick days, hence it can be filtered out\n  filter(syear != 2020)\n```\n\nSince the Sick Days values are recorded for the previous year, the Sick Days variable was shifted by one year. This adjustment allowed it to align the Sick Days values with other variables from the same year, such as commute distance. Consequently, the data for year 2020 is removed to ensure that the analysis accurately reflects the year 2019. This way, both sick days and commute distance data correspond to the same time period, enabling a more accurate analysis.\n\n```{r peak into data, include=TRUE, results='hide', fig.show='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# similar number of participants across the years\ntable(combined_df$syear)\n\n# a majority of the participants' fist year is 2015 followed by 2017\ncombined_df %>%  \n  group_by(pid) %>% \n  summarise(first_year = min(syear)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=first_year)) + geom_histogram() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"First Year of Interview per Persons\")\n\n# majority of the participants' last interview was in 2019\ncombined_df %>%  \n  group_by(pid) %>% \n  summarise(last_year = max(syear)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=last_year)) + geom_histogram() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Last Year of Interview per Persons\")\n```\n\n```{r age, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n#filtering unique IDs\nunique_ids_df <- combined_df %>%\n  distinct(pid, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\ndistinct_count <- length(unique(combined_df$pid))\n\nmean_age <- round(mean(combined_df$age), 1)\n\n# calculating gender ratio\nunique_ids_df$gender <- as.numeric(unique_ids_df$gender)\n\ngender_counts <- unique_ids_df %>%\n  filter(!is.na(gender)) %>%\n  count(gender)\n\nnum_females <- gender_counts$n[gender_counts$gender == 2]\nnum_males <- gender_counts$n[gender_counts$gender == 1]\n\n# Calculate gender ratio\ngender_ratio <- round((num_females / num_males), 2)\n\n# Age distribution\nggplot(unique_ids_df, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"#f89089\", color = \"white\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(age)), color = \"#32b6b8\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~syear) +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 1.

Visualization of participants' first and last year of interviews indicates that a high number of participants were in 2015 compared to the other years. However this was balanced in the final dataset after the cleaning process which resulted majority participated throughout all five years of the study period. This continuity is crucial for ensuring unbiased results. The participants average age is `r mean_age` and the gender ratio is `r gender_ratio`, indicating a slightly lower number of female participants compared to male participants.\n\n### Employment Status\n\n```{r employment status 1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# look at the percentage of unemployed and NAs each year\n# Calculate the percentage of \"Nicht erwerbstaetig\" by year\ncombined_percentage_by_year <- unique_ids_df %>%\n  group_by(syear) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total = n(),\n    combined_count = sum(as_factor(employment_status) %in% c(\"[9] Nicht erwerbstaetig\") | \n                         is.na(employment_status), \n                         na.rm = TRUE),\n    combined_percentage = round((combined_count / total) * 100, 2))\n\nmean_percent <- round(mean(combined_percentage_by_year$Percent), 2)\n\n# Rename columns for display in the table\ncolnames(combined_percentage_by_year) <- c(\"Year\", \"Total Participants\", \"Unemployed Count\", \"Percent\")\n\nkable(combined_percentage_by_year, \n      caption = \"Table 1.

Since 2020 is not the primary focus of this study, we assume that WFH was not an option during the years of interest. Consequently, we will exclude the WFH information from the dataset.\n\n# 4: Removing outlieres in Income\nggplot(combined_df, aes(x = income)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\ncombined_df <- combined_df %>%\n  filter(income <= 15000)\n```\n\nOn average, `r mean_percent` of participants each year are either unemployed or have missing data for other reasons. Additionally, an average of `r round(mean(job_change_count_by_year $ja_percentage), 2)` of participants change jobs (employers) each year. Given the high rate of job changes, it is important to also analyze changes in workplace location. Although the SOEP does not record data on workplace changes directly, this can be inferred from the commute distance to work. The survey question asks: `\"How far (in kilometers) is it from where you live to where you work?\"` Any change in workplace is expected to be reflected in changes to this distance. Notably, there is no recorded data on working from home (WFH) for the years of interest in this analysis.\n\n\n### Health Data\n\nAccording to the [German Statistics Office](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Labour/Labour-Market/Quality-Employment/Dimension2/2_3_StaffSickLeave.html), the average number of sickness absence days in 2019 was 11. To ensure the validity of our analysis, we have addressed outliers in the data. We assume that extreme values of sick days could either indicate chronic illness or data entry errors. Therefore, we have excluded sickness absence days exceeding two months from our dataset.\n\n\n```{r health data prep 1, include=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# after filtering out unemployed participants and negative labels\ncombined_df$employment_status <- as.factor(combined_df$employment_status)\n\nfiltered_data <- combined_df %>%\n  filter(!is.na(employment_status) & employment_status != \"[9] Nicht erwerbstaetig\")\n\nhealth_variables <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(!is.na(sick_days_PY) & !is.na(hospital_stays) & !is.na(doctor_visit_L3) & !is.na(health_state)) %>%\n  mutate(across(c(hospital_stays, sick_days_LY, doctor_visit_L3, health_state), ~as.numeric(zap_labels(.))))\n\n# plotting to see any outliers\nlong_df <- health_variables %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(hospital_stays, doctor_visit_L3, sick_days_PY, health_state),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"value\")\n\nggplot(long_df, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#32b6b8\", color = \"#f78f88\") +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 2.

Doctor visits in the last 3 months, 2. Number of hospital stays, 3. Number of sickness absence days, and 4. Self-reported health status, ranging from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest). The trends for these variables did not show significant similarities, and none of the variables appeared anomalous. Consequently, we selected the \"Number of sickness absence days\" and \"Self-reported health status\" for the analysis, as these are commonly used by researchers, including Goerke and Lorenz (2017), in their studies utilizing SOEP data. \n\n```{r health data prep 2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# Calculate summary statistics for each variable\ndv_summary <- summary(health_variables$doctor_visit_L3)\nhos_summary <- summary(health_variables$hospital_stays)\nsd_summary <- summary(health_variables$sick_days_PY)\nhes_summary <- summary(health_variables$health_state)\n\n# Combine the results into a data frame\nsummary_table <- data.frame(\n  Statistic = names(dv_summary),\n  Doctor_Visits_L3 = as.numeric(dv_summary),\n  Hospital_Stays = as.numeric(hos_summary),\n  Sick_Days_PY = as.numeric(sd_summary),\n  Health_Status = as.numeric(hes_summary))\n\n# Create and display a table using gt\nsummary_table_gt <- summary_table %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Table 2.

Then average travel time by different commute distance category was calculated. Which shows Long Distance Commuter traveling on average `r long_dist_time` minutes one way whereas people commute up to 10 kms with on average `r non_commuter_time` minutes of travel time.\n\n```{r commute data prep 2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# removing outlier in commute time before plotting relationship with commute distance\n\nmean_min <- filtered_data %>%\n  summarize(mean = mean(commute_min, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  pull(mean)\n\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_min < 150)\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = commute_km, y = commute_min)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#f9918a\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 4.

The linear mixed model analyzing the relationship between commute distance (in kilometers) and commute time (in minutes), while accounting for individual differences. The model shows a strong positive relationship between distance and time, with each kilometer of commute distance associated with an increase of about 1.2 minutes in commute time (fixed effect estimate). The random effects indicate substantial variation between individuals (pid), with a standard deviation of 13.73 minutes which is (`r round((13.73/mean_min*100),2)`) of the mean, suggesting a significant degree of variability relative to the average commute time. These could be factors specific to each person (like mode of transportation or route choices) play a significant role in determining commute time (@liao_disparities_2020). The high t-value (164.8) for the fixed effect suggests that the relationship between distance and time is statistically significant. Overall, this model demonstrates that while commute distance is a strong predictor of commute time, individual factors also contribute substantially to the variation in commute duration.\n\n:::\n\n<hr>\n\n<!-- Insert the horizontal line here -->\n---\n\n\n##  Final Dataset\n\nAfter the data preparation stage, the dataset consists of 12 columns, including 11 original variables and one additional categorical column. The dataset contains `r nrow(filtered_data)` observations that have been filtered and cleaned to ensure a balanced dataframe with no missing values. The variables are categorized into three groups: Health, Commute, and Socio-economic.\n\nThe analysis uses `Sickness absence` notified to the employer as the dependent variable, with `Self-reported health status` serving as a reference variable. After identifying a strong positive linear relationship between `commute distance` and `commute time`, `commute distance` is selected as the independent variable. Additionally, the analysis considers other variables such as gender, age, income, employment status, and employer change.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Descriptive Analysis\n\n```{r descriptive analysis, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# creating custom function\ncustom_summary <- function(x) {\n  # Calculate summary statistics\n  result <- c(\n    Mean = round(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    SD = round(sd(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    Min = round(min(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    Max = round(max(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2))\n  return(result)}\n\n# Compute summary statistics for each category\nfull_sample <- custom_summary(filtered_data$sick_days_PY)\nfull_sample_count <- nrow(filtered_data)  \nfull_sample_percentage <- 100  \n\nnon_commuter <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_category == \"Non-commuter\") %>%\n  pull(sick_days_PY) %>%\n  custom_summary()\n\nshort_distance <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_category == \"Short Distance\") %>%\n  pull(sick_days_PY) %>%\n  custom_summary()\n\nmedium_distance <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_category == \"Medium Distance\") %>%\n  pull(sick_days_PY) %>%\n  custom_summary()\n\nlong_distance <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_category == \"Long Distance\") %>%\n  pull(sick_days_PY) %>%\n  custom_summary()\n\n# Number and percentage of participants by commuter category\nnumber_commuter <- filtered_data %>%\n  group_by(commute_category) %>%\n  summarize(n = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  mutate(percentage = round((n / sum(n)) * 100, 2))\n\n# Create a data frame for summary statistics\nsummary_stats <- data.frame(\n  Category = c(\"Full Sample\", \"Non-commuter\", \"Short Distance\", \"Medium Distance\", \"Long Distance\"),\n  Mean = c(full_sample[\"Mean\"], non_commuter[\"Mean\"], short_distance[\"Mean\"], medium_distance[\"Mean\"], long_distance[\"Mean\"]),\n  SD = c(full_sample[\"SD\"], non_commuter[\"SD\"], short_distance[\"SD\"], medium_distance[\"SD\"], long_distance[\"SD\"]),\n  Min = c(full_sample[\"Min\"], non_commuter[\"Min\"], short_distance[\"Min\"], medium_distance[\"Min\"], long_distance[\"Min\"]),\n  Max = c(full_sample[\"Max\"], non_commuter[\"Max\"], short_distance[\"Max\"], medium_distance[\"Max\"], long_distance[\"Max\"]),\n  Count = c(full_sample_count, \n            number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Non-commuter\") %>% pull(n),\n            number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Short Distance\") %>% pull(n),\n            number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Medium Distance\") %>% pull(n),\n            number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Long Distance\") %>% pull(n)),  \n  Percentage = c(full_sample_percentage, \n                 number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Non-commuter\") %>% pull(percentage),\n                 number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Short Distance\") %>% pull(percentage),\n                 number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Medium Distance\") %>% pull(percentage),\n                 number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Long Distance\") %>% pull(percentage)))\n\n# Create the table using gt\ntable_gt <- summary_stats %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  tab_header(title = \"Table 5.

Table 4 compares the average number of sick days across different commuter categories and does not show significant differences between them. However, high standard deviations across all categories indicate a wide range of commute distances within each group.\n\n```{r descriptive analysis 2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# gender difference in commute distance and sick days\ngender_labels <- c(\n  \"1\" = \"Male\",\n  \"2\" = \"Female\")\n\n# Apply the mapping\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(gender_label = factor(gender, levels = names(gender_labels), labels = gender_labels), na.rm = TRUE) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(gender_label))\n\n# commute distance histogram\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = commute_km, fill = gender_label)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.8, color = \"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Graph 5.

These findings align with the results from @chidambaram_work-trip_2021, which explain that men are more likely to drive for longer commutes. In contrast, women often engage in trip chaining (combining multiple trips) due to childcare responsibilities, which can affect their overall commuting behavior.\n\n```{r descriptive analysis 3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# sick days histogram\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(sick_days_PY, fill = gender_label)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.7, color = \"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Graph 6.

This is interesting because many studies show that women generally have higher rates of sickness absence compared to men. For instance, a study by @gimenez-nadal_commuting_2022 found that using data from2011 to 2017, a 1% increase in workers' daily commute correlates with an increase in annual sickness absence of 0.018% for male workers and 0.027% for female workers.\n\n```{r descriptive analysis 6, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = factor(health_state), y = commute_km)) +\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"#f9918a\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 7.

This suggests that people within these health categories may have diverse commuting behaviors or requirements. Interestingly, individuals who self-report as being in a \"bad\" health state tend to commute shorter distances. This observation could suggest a case of reverse causation, where long commutes do not necessarily deteriorate health; rather, those with poorer health may choose, or be forced, to undertake shorter commutes (@raza_commuting_2021).\n\n```{r descriptive analysis 4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# commuter type by employment status\n# giving English labels as the original is in German\nemployment_status_labels <- c(\n  \"1\" = \"Full-time\",\n  \"2\" = \"Part-time\",\n  \"3\" = \"Ausbildung\",\n  \"4\" = \"Low-income earner\",\n  \"8\" = \"Workshop for handicapped\")\n\n# Apply the mapping\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(employment_status = factor(employment_status, levels = names(employment_status_labels), labels = employment_status_labels))\n\nsummarized_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  group_by(commute_category, employment_status) %>%\n  summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\nggplot(summarized_data, aes(x = employment_status, y = count, fill = commute_category)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Graph 8.

In contrast, low-income earners and individuals undergoing Ausbildung typically commute less than 25 km. According to Goerke and Lorenz (2017), this may be because full-time employees are more likely to be compensated for long commutes, making the trade-off between private time and commuting more acceptable. \n\n```{r descriptive analysis 5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# income and commuter type correlation: weak postive at cor = 0.19\ncor_km_income <- cor(filtered_data$commute_km, filtered_data$income, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = commute_km, y = income)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#f9918a\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", span = 0.8, se = FALSE, color = \"#32b6b8\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 9.

However, commuting distances up to an average of 100 km are generally associated with higher correlation. Beyond this distance, income tends to decline as the distance increases.\n\nIn our data, the average commuting trip length did not see a significant increase between 2015 and 2019. The average one-way commuting distance of workers is `r round(mean(filtered_data$commute_km), 2)` kilometres. This is in line with a range of other studies employing German data (@hedemann_further_nodate). Hence, our sample selection is likely unrelated to commuting behaviour.\n\n## Mixed Effects Analysis\n\nIn this  analysis, I used a statistical technique a linear mixed model to explore how different factors affect the number of sick days people take from work. This model helps to consider both individual differences and overall trends. I included variables such as commute distance, income, age, job changes, and whether individuals work full-time. I also accounted for changes over time by incorporating the year into the model. To ensure our results were accurate, I standardized these factors, which means I compared them on a common scale. This approach allowed me to understand how each factor, like a longer commute or higher income, influences sick days while also accounting for variations among different people. The main health variable is sickness absence days (Model1), but also to compare I included Self-reported Health State (Model2) in the analysis.\n\n```{r model fitting, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n#Creating dummy variable for job change\nfiltered_data$job_change <- as.numeric(filtered_data$job_change)\n\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(job_change_dummy = ifelse(job_change == 1, 1, 0),\n         gender_dummy = ifelse(gender_label == \"Male\", 1, 0),\n         full_time_dummy = ifelse(employment_status == \"Full-time\", 1, 0))\n\n# linear mixed-effects models fitting \n# Prepare the data by scaling the continues variables\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    commute_km_z = scale(commute_km),\n    age_z = scale(age),\n    income_z = scale(income),\n    syear_z = scale(syear))\n\n# Model 1: Number of Days Off Work\nmodel1 <- lmer(sick_days_PY ~ commute_km_z + gender_dummy + age_z + income_z + \n               job_change_dummy + full_time_dummy + syear_z + (1|pid), \n               data = filtered_data)\n\n\n# Model 2: Current Health State\nmodel2 <- lmer(health_state ~ commute_km_z + gender_dummy + age_z + income_z + \n               job_change_dummy + full_time_dummy + syear_z + (1|pid), \n               data = filtered_data)\n\n# Check summaries\nsummary(model1)\nsummary(model2)\n\n```\n\nBoth models analyze data from 11,495 observations across 6,649 unique individuals. The variables were standardized to ensure they are on a common scale for analysis. To interpret the results in the context of the original data, the effects are expressed in terms of standard deviations of the variables. The key findings are as follows:\n\n- The much larger random effects in Model 1 suggest that sickness absence varies more between and within individuals compared to self-reported health state.\n\n- Longer commutes are associated with slightly more sick days, every 17 km increase in distance associated with 2.7 more sick days but have minimal impact on self-reported health. However the findings are statistically not significant.\n\n- Gender has a small negative effect on sick days (males taking fewer sick days (0.3) than women) but negligible effect on self-reported health.\n\n- Age is positively associated with both more sick days (every 11 years increase in age associated with people take about 7.4 more sick days) and worse self-reported health, with a stronger relative effect on health status.\n\n- Higher income is associated with fewer sick days and better self-reported health. The effect is relatively strong in both models.\n\n- Job change is associated with fewer sick days but has minimal impact on self-reported health.\n\n- Full-time employment is strongly associated with more sick days (1.49 more sick days than other groups) but has negligible impact on self-reported health.\n\n- There's a trend of increasing sick days (0.8 days every 1.6 years) over time, but minimal change in self-reported health status.\n\n- The models show different sensitivity to predictors, with sickness absence (Model 1) being more responsive to work-related factors (full-time status, job change) compared to self-reported health status (Model 2).\n\n```{r model result, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# tidying model result\nfixed_effects1 <- tidy(model1, effects = \"fixed\")\nfixed_effects2 <- tidy(model2, effects = \"fixed\")\n\n# Creating result table\nsimple_table <- bind_rows(\n  fixed_effects1 %>% mutate(Model = \"Model 1\"),\n  fixed_effects2 %>% mutate(Model = \"Model 2\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Variable = case_when(\n      term == \"commute_km_z\" ~ \"Commute Distance\",\n      term == \"gender_dummy\" ~ \"Gender\",\n      term == \"age_z\" ~ \"Age\",\n      term == \"income_z\" ~ \"Income\",\n      term == \"job_change_dummy\" ~ \"Job Change\",\n      term == \"full_time_dummy\" ~ \"Full-time Status\",\n      term == \"syear_z\" ~ \"Year\",\n      term == \"(Intercept)\" ~ \"Intercept\"),\n    Effect = ifelse(statistic > 1.96 | statistic < -1.96, \n                    ifelse(estimate > 0, \"Increase\", \"Decrease\"), \n                    \"No significant effect\"),\n    Significance = ifelse(abs(statistic) > 3.291, \"***\",\n                   ifelse(abs(statistic) > 2.576, \"**\",\n                   ifelse(abs(statistic) > 1.96, \"*\", \"\"))),\n    `Relative Impact` = abs(estimate) / max(abs(estimate))) %>%\n  select(Model, Variable, Effect, Significance, `Relative Impact`) %>%\n  arrange(Model, desc(`Relative Impact`))\n\n# Display the table\nkable(simple_table, format = \"html\", escape = FALSE, caption = \"Table 7.

However, an analysis using the SOEP data in Germany reveals different findings. This study aimed to extend the analysis of the relationship between commute distance and sickness absence to more recent years (2015-2019) using longitudinal data.\n\nDescriptive analysis confirmed that full-time employees are the primary long- and medium-distance commuters, with their income positively correlating with commute distances up to 100 km. Generally, women tend to have shorter commutes, while men usually take fewer sick days. Although there are no significant differences in sickness absence between commuter types, within-group analysis shows that a higher number of standard deviations in sick days indicates greater variability. Additionally, individuals who rate their health as poorer are more likely to avoid longer commutes.\n\nSickness absence varies significantly between and within individuals, whereas self-reported health state shows less variation. Longer commutes slightly increase sick days (2.7 more for every 17 km), but this effect is statistically insignificant. Gender has a minor effect on sick days, with males taking fewer sick days (0.3 days less than females). Age is associated with more sick days (7.4 more for every 11 years older) and worse self-reported health, with a stronger impact on health status. Higher income correlates with fewer sick days and better self-reported health, showing a strong effect in both models. Full-time employment is linked to significantly more sick days (1.49 more). There is a trend of increasing sick days over time, but self-reported health remains stable. Overall, sickness absence is more sensitive to work-related factors than self-reported health.\n\n# Limitations and Next Steps\nThe study only took account of commute distance as the key dependent variables However the research showing the significant effects of commute mode and travel time (@guo_commuting_2020). Different modes of commuting had varying impacts on emotional wellbeing. For example, walking commuters reported higher life satisfaction compared to car users, while bicycle commuting was positively related to quality of life. Conversely, car commuters experienced lower positive emotions with longer commutes compared to those using public transport or multimodal commuting (@liu_systematic_2022).\n\nAnother limitation of this study is the choice and interpretation of the mixed effects model and its results. Although I compared results from both fixed effects and mixed effects models and found the latter more suitable for unbalanced panel data due to its ability to account for time-invariant variables, unobserved variables and randomness, this was my first experience with mixed effects models on an unbalanced panel. As I am still gaining experience in this area, there may be limitations in my understanding of the possible models and their interpretation. I welcome any suggestions on how I could enhance my approach and address these potential limitations.\n\nBased on the identified limitations, I suggest the following next steps:\n\n- **Include Commute Mode in the Analysis:** Incorporate data on different commute modes to examine how various modes affect both positive and negative outcomes related to sickness absence and self-reported health.\n\n- **Analyze COVID Impact:** Although this study intentionally excluded the effects of COVID, future research could benefit from including data from COVID-affected years. Comparing pre- and post-COVID states could provide valuable insights into how the pandemic has influenced commuting and health outcomes.\n\n- **Address Gaps in Longitudinal Data:** For longitudinal surveys like SOEP with missing years, explore and identify the best methods and models for handling gaps in data to improve the robustness and accuracy of future analyses.\n\n- **Investigate Within-Group Variations:** The data showed significant within-group variations the in key variables. Further analysis is needed to identify the underlying causes of these variations and understand their implications.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Variables of the study\n\n- Commute Distance in kilometers                    \n- Sickness Absence Day                \n- Self Reported Health                \n- Employment Status                   \n- Income of Individual                              \n- Commute Time (represented by commute distance)\n- Age\n- Gender\n- Year\n- Job Change (employer)\n- PID\n\nThe full details of variables can be found in [Topics of SOEP-Core](https://companion.soep.de/Topics_of_SOEPcore/index.html).\n\n## Graphics and Results that were in the background\n\nFirst and last interview year of the participants\n```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# a maority of the participants' fist year is 2015 followed by 2017\ncombined_df %>%  \n  group_by(pid) %>% \n  summarise(first_year = min(syear)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=first_year)) + geom_histogram() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"First Year of Interview per Persons\")\n\n# majority of the participants' last interview was in 2019\ncombined_df %>%  \n  group_by(pid) %>% \n  summarise(last_year = max(syear)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=last_year)) + geom_histogram() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Last Year of Interview per Persons\")\n```\n\nNumber of participants each year\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# similar number of participants across the years\ntable(combined_df$syear)\n```\n\nJob change percentage by year\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nkable(job_change_count_by_year)\n```\n\nIncome outliers\n```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\nggplot(combined_df, aes(x = income)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n## Mixed Effects Model Summary\n\nModel 1: Sickness Absence\n```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nsummary(model1)\n```\n\nModel 2: Health Status\n```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nsummary(model2)\n```\n\n# References","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/udwal/Documents/Studies_Viadrina/Becoming Data Fluent/Fluent2024/Final Project\")\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)\nknitr::include_graphics(\"soep.jpg\")\n\nlibrary(rmdformats)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(plm)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tinytex)\nlibrary(tidyselect)\nlibrary(readstata13)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(moderndive)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(broom.mixed)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(webshot2)\n```\n\n# Abstract\nThe study builds on previous study by @goerke_commuting_2017 and investigates the potential correlation between sickness absence and commute distance using a fixed effects model on SOEP data from 2015 to 2019. While longer commutes are associated with a slight increase in sick days (2.7 additional days for every 17 km), this effect is statistically insignificant. Age is positively correlated with both more sick days (7.4 additional days for every 11 years older) and poorer self-reported health, with a stronger impact on health status. Higher income is associated with fewer sick days and better self-reported health. Full-time employment is associated with a significant increase in sick days (1.49 more days). Additionally, there is a noticeable trend of rising sick days over time.\n\n\n# Introduction\nAround the world, researchers are confirming that the negative effects of long commutes are linked to poorer health, increased absenteeism from work due to illness, and higher inactivity, which can lead to obesity and other health issues (@gimenez-nadal_commuting_2022, @raza_commuting_2021, @guo_commuting_2020). Two empirical studies in Germany using SOEP data have formally tested the relationship between commuting and sickness absence (@goerke_commuting_2017; @ommeren_are_2011), and their conclusions differ. While the former study identifies a positive correlation between commuting distance and sickness absence in Germany, the latter finds no such relationship. However, they observed that employees who commute long distances are absent approximately 20% more often than those who commute up to 10 km.\n\n\n## This Project \nIn this project, I aim to study the relationship between Health and Commute using the [German Socio-Economic Panel Survey](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.412809.de/sozio-oekonomisches_panel__soep.html) (SOEP). The SOEP is a comprehensive longitudinal survey conducted annually that has been running since 1984, focusing on the socio-economic conditions of households in Germany. Each year, the survey collects data from approximately 30,000 individuals in around 15,000 households  using mixed-mode design, including face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, online surveys, and paper-based interviews. The data collection process is designed to ensure the survey's longitudinal nature, allowing for the observation of social and economic changes over time. The access to the data is restricted to researchers for scientific purposes or for teaching purposes.

SOEP Topics](soep.jpg)\n\n## Study Hyphothesis and Questions\nThe literature review indicates that a longer commute distance is associated with a higher number of reported sick days. Based on this evidence, the study employs the following hypotheses:\n\n**Null Hypothesis:** There is no relationship between commute distance and the number of days off from work due to sickness.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis:** A longer commute distance is associated with a higher number of days off from work due to sickness.\n\nFurthermore the study questions are driven as follows:\n\n- How do commuting characteristics, such as distance and time, impact various health outcomes, including sick days and current health status?\n- How does this impact vary across different demographic groups, such as age and gender, or according to various economic factors, such as income and employment status?\n\n## Methodology\nThis study builds on the work of @goerke_commuting_2017, who conducted a comprehensive analysis using SOEP data from the years 2003 to 2011. In their research, focused on commuting distance and sickness absence as key variables, while also considering personal characteristics and job-related indicators. Their analysis employed various econometric models, including Negative Binomial Regression and Fixed-Effects Least Squares Models.\n\nAlthough this study will not delve into as much detail as the aforementioned research, it will extend the analysis of the relationship between commuting distance and sickness absence using data from five years (2015 to 2019) through Mixed Effects Model Analysis. Additionally, the study will examine various demographic and economic indicators, including age, gender, income, and employment status.\n\nThe analysis consists of two parts. Descriptive analysis offer a snapshot of the data, providing a summary of its main variables. In contrast, mixed effects analysis delivers a deeper understanding by estimating the effects of predictors while accounting for random variability. This approach leads to more nuanced conclusions about the relationships within the data, which are crucial for decision-making and hypothesis testing.\n\n$$\n  y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{ij1} + \\beta_2 x_{ij2} + \\ldots + \\beta_p x_{ijp} + u_{0j} + \\epsilon_{ij}\n  $$\n\nDue to inconsistencies in the data, such as missing commute distance information for 2016 and 2018, the chosen model is well-suited for handling unequally spaced time points, time invariant and missing data. To avoid the influence of COVID-19, the year 2020 will not be included in the analysis, even though data for that year is available.\n\n# Data \n\n## Data Preparation\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### General\n\nI began by extracting data from a comprehensive dataset, focusing on variables pertinent to the study. Initially, 13 variables were identified using the Code Book (@bartels_soep-core_2023) and imported from a large dataset. The data was then filtered to include only individuals within the economically active age group (18-65) and for the years relevant to the study. The SOEP survey dataset includes negative codes to denote labels where data is unavailable, irrelevant, or not applicable for certain periods. To facilitate accurate analysis in R, these negative coded labels are converted to NA to represent missing data.\n\n```{r importing data, results='hide', echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/udwal/Documents/Studies_Viadrina/Becoming Data Fluent/Fluent2024/Final Project\")\n\n# Getting individual data from pl\nsoep_df <- read_dta(\"pl.dta\", \n                          col_select = c(syear, ple0055, ple0046, ple0008, ple0072, plb0158, plb0592, pid, plb0471_h, plb0031_h, plb0022_h))\n\n# Getting the individual data from pequiv that were not in pl\ndata_pequiv <- read_dta(\"pequiv.dta\", \n         col_select = c(pid, syear, d11101, d11102ll))\n\n# Joining the two dataset\ncombined_df <- soep_df %>%\n  full_join(data_pequiv, by = c(\"pid\", \"syear\"))\n\n# Converting negative labels into NA as preparation of data\ncombined_df[combined_df < 0] <- NA\n\n# Renaming columns for ease of use\ncombined_df <- combined_df %>%\n  rename(\n    hospital_stays = ple0055,\n    sick_days_LY = ple0046,\n    health_state = ple0008,\n    doctor_visit_L3 = ple0072,\n    commute_km = plb0158,\n    commute_min = plb0592,\n    gender = d11102ll,\n    age = d11101,\n    income = plb0471_h,\n    job_change = plb0031_h,\n    employment_status = plb0022_h)\n\n# Filtering out the years only relevant to the research questions\ncombined_df <- combined_df %>%\n  filter(age >= 18 & age <= 65, syear >= 2015 & syear <= 2020)\n\n# sick days are recorded for the previous year, hence shifting the values to the previous year so the relationship with other variables can be analyzed without lag in the data.\ncombined_df <- combined_df %>%\n  mutate(syear = as.numeric(syear)) %>%\n  mutate(sick_days_LY = as.numeric(sick_days_LY)) %>%\n  group_by(pid) %>%\n  arrange(pid, syear) %>%\n  # Create the previous year variable\n  mutate(sick_days_PY = dplyr::lead(sick_days_LY, n = 1)) %>%\n  # Fill NA values with the most recent non-NA value\n  fill(sick_days_PY, .direction = \"up\") %>%\n  # Ungroup\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # 2020 was pulled only for the reason to get 2019 sick days, hence it can be filtered out\n  filter(syear != 2020)\n```\n\nSince the Sick Days values are recorded for the previous year, the Sick Days variable was shifted by one year. This adjustment allowed it to align the Sick Days values with other variables from the same year, such as commute distance. Consequently, the data for year 2020 is removed to ensure that the analysis accurately reflects the year 2019. This way, both sick days and commute distance data correspond to the same time period, enabling a more accurate analysis.\n\n```{r peak into data, include=TRUE, results='hide', fig.show='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# similar number of participants across the years\ntable(combined_df$syear)\n\n# a majority of the participants' fist year is 2015 followed by 2017\ncombined_df %>%  \n  group_by(pid) %>% \n  summarise(first_year = min(syear)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=first_year)) + geom_histogram() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"First Year of Interview per Persons\")\n\n# majority of the participants' last interview was in 2019\ncombined_df %>%  \n  group_by(pid) %>% \n  summarise(last_year = max(syear)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=last_year)) + geom_histogram() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Last Year of Interview per Persons\")\n```\n\n```{r age, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n#filtering unique IDs\nunique_ids_df <- combined_df %>%\n  distinct(pid, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\ndistinct_count <- length(unique(combined_df$pid))\n\nmean_age <- round(mean(combined_df$age), 1)\n\n# calculating gender ratio\nunique_ids_df$gender <- as.numeric(unique_ids_df$gender)\n\ngender_counts <- unique_ids_df %>%\n  filter(!is.na(gender)) %>%\n  count(gender)\n\nnum_females <- gender_counts$n[gender_counts$gender == 2]\nnum_males <- gender_counts$n[gender_counts$gender == 1]\n\n# Calculate gender ratio\ngender_ratio <- round((num_females / num_males), 2)\n\n# Age distribution\nggplot(unique_ids_df, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"#f89089\", color = \"white\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(age)), color = \"#32b6b8\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~syear) +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 1.

Visualization of participants' first and last year of interviews indicates that a high number of participants were in 2015 compared to the other years. However this was balanced in the final dataset after the cleaning process which resulted majority participated throughout all five years of the study period. This continuity is crucial for ensuring unbiased results. The participants average age is `r mean_age` and the gender ratio is `r gender_ratio`, indicating a slightly lower number of female participants compared to male participants.\n\n### Employment Status\n\n```{r employment status 1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# look at the percentage of unemployed and NAs each year\n# Calculate the percentage of \"Nicht erwerbstaetig\" by year\ncombined_percentage_by_year <- unique_ids_df %>%\n  group_by(syear) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total = n(),\n    combined_count = sum(as_factor(employment_status) %in% c(\"[9] Nicht erwerbstaetig\") | \n                         is.na(employment_status), \n                         na.rm = TRUE),\n    combined_percentage = round((combined_count / total) * 100, 2))\n\nmean_percent <- round(mean(combined_percentage_by_year$Percent), 2)\n\n# Rename columns for display in the table\ncolnames(combined_percentage_by_year) <- c(\"Year\", \"Total Participants\", \"Unemployed Count\", \"Percent\")\n\nkable(combined_percentage_by_year, \n      caption = \"Table 1.

Since 2020 is not the primary focus of this study, we assume that WFH was not an option during the years of interest. Consequently, we will exclude the WFH information from the dataset.\n\n# 4: Removing outlieres in Income\nggplot(combined_df, aes(x = income)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\ncombined_df <- combined_df %>%\n  filter(income <= 15000)\n```\n\nOn average, `r mean_percent` of participants each year are either unemployed or have missing data for other reasons. Additionally, an average of `r round(mean(job_change_count_by_year $ja_percentage), 2)` of participants change jobs (employers) each year. Given the high rate of job changes, it is important to also analyze changes in workplace location. Although the SOEP does not record data on workplace changes directly, this can be inferred from the commute distance to work. The survey question asks: `\"How far (in kilometers) is it from where you live to where you work?\"` Any change in workplace is expected to be reflected in changes to this distance. Notably, there is no recorded data on working from home (WFH) for the years of interest in this analysis.\n\n\n### Health Data\n\nAccording to the [German Statistics Office](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Labour/Labour-Market/Quality-Employment/Dimension2/2_3_StaffSickLeave.html), the average number of sickness absence days in 2019 was 11. To ensure the validity of our analysis, we have addressed outliers in the data. We assume that extreme values of sick days could either indicate chronic illness or data entry errors. Therefore, we have excluded sickness absence days exceeding two months from our dataset.\n\n\n```{r health data prep 1, include=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# after filtering out unemployed participants and negative labels\ncombined_df$employment_status <- as.factor(combined_df$employment_status)\n\nfiltered_data <- combined_df %>%\n  filter(!is.na(employment_status) & employment_status != \"[9] Nicht erwerbstaetig\")\n\nhealth_variables <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(!is.na(sick_days_PY) & !is.na(hospital_stays) & !is.na(doctor_visit_L3) & !is.na(health_state)) %>%\n  mutate(across(c(hospital_stays, sick_days_LY, doctor_visit_L3, health_state), ~as.numeric(zap_labels(.))))\n\n# plotting to see any outliers\nlong_df <- health_variables %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(hospital_stays, doctor_visit_L3, sick_days_PY, health_state),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"value\")\n\nggplot(long_df, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#32b6b8\", color = \"#f78f88\") +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 2.

Doctor visits in the last 3 months, 2. Number of hospital stays, 3. Number of sickness absence days, and 4. Self-reported health status, ranging from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest). The trends for these variables did not show significant similarities, and none of the variables appeared anomalous. Consequently, we selected the \"Number of sickness absence days\" and \"Self-reported health status\" for the analysis, as these are commonly used by researchers, including Goerke and Lorenz (2017), in their studies utilizing SOEP data. \n\n```{r health data prep 2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# Calculate summary statistics for each variable\ndv_summary <- summary(health_variables$doctor_visit_L3)\nhos_summary <- summary(health_variables$hospital_stays)\nsd_summary <- summary(health_variables$sick_days_PY)\nhes_summary <- summary(health_variables$health_state)\n\n# Combine the results into a data frame\nsummary_table <- data.frame(\n  Statistic = names(dv_summary),\n  Doctor_Visits_L3 = as.numeric(dv_summary),\n  Hospital_Stays = as.numeric(hos_summary),\n  Sick_Days_PY = as.numeric(sd_summary),\n  Health_Status = as.numeric(hes_summary))\n\n# Create and display a table using gt\nsummary_table_gt <- summary_table %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Table 2.

Then average travel time by different commute distance category was calculated. Which shows Long Distance Commuter traveling on average `r long_dist_time` minutes one way whereas people commute up to 10 kms with on average `r non_commuter_time` minutes of travel time.\n\n```{r commute data prep 2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# removing outlier in commute time before plotting relationship with commute distance\n\nmean_min <- filtered_data %>%\n  summarize(mean = mean(commute_min, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  pull(mean)\n\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_min < 150)\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = commute_km, y = commute_min)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#f9918a\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 4.

The linear mixed model analyzing the relationship between commute distance (in kilometers) and commute time (in minutes), while accounting for individual differences. The model shows a strong positive relationship between distance and time, with each kilometer of commute distance associated with an increase of about 1.2 minutes in commute time (fixed effect estimate). The random effects indicate substantial variation between individuals (pid), with a standard deviation of 13.73 minutes which is (`r round((13.73/mean_min*100),2)`) of the mean, suggesting a significant degree of variability relative to the average commute time. These could be factors specific to each person (like mode of transportation or route choices) play a significant role in determining commute time (@liao_disparities_2020). The high t-value (164.8) for the fixed effect suggests that the relationship between distance and time is statistically significant. Overall, this model demonstrates that while commute distance is a strong predictor of commute time, individual factors also contribute substantially to the variation in commute duration.\n\n:::\n\n<hr>\n\n<!-- Insert the horizontal line here -->\n---\n\n\n##  Final Dataset\n\nAfter the data preparation stage, the dataset consists of 12 columns, including 11 original variables and one additional categorical column. The dataset contains `r nrow(filtered_data)` observations that have been filtered and cleaned to ensure a balanced dataframe with no missing values. The variables are categorized into three groups: Health, Commute, and Socio-economic.\n\nThe analysis uses `Sickness absence` notified to the employer as the dependent variable, with `Self-reported health status` serving as a reference variable. After identifying a strong positive linear relationship between `commute distance` and `commute time`, `commute distance` is selected as the independent variable. Additionally, the analysis considers other variables such as gender, age, income, employment status, and employer change.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Descriptive Analysis\n\n```{r descriptive analysis, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# creating custom function\ncustom_summary <- function(x) {\n  # Calculate summary statistics\n  result <- c(\n    Mean = round(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    SD = round(sd(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    Min = round(min(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    Max = round(max(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2))\n  return(result)}\n\n# Compute summary statistics for each category\nfull_sample <- custom_summary(filtered_data$sick_days_PY)\nfull_sample_count <- nrow(filtered_data)  \nfull_sample_percentage <- 100  \n\nnon_commuter <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_category == \"Non-commuter\") %>%\n  pull(sick_days_PY) %>%\n  custom_summary()\n\nshort_distance <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_category == \"Short Distance\") %>%\n  pull(sick_days_PY) %>%\n  custom_summary()\n\nmedium_distance <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_category == \"Medium Distance\") %>%\n  pull(sick_days_PY) %>%\n  custom_summary()\n\nlong_distance <- filtered_data %>%\n  filter(commute_category == \"Long Distance\") %>%\n  pull(sick_days_PY) %>%\n  custom_summary()\n\n# Number and percentage of participants by commuter category\nnumber_commuter <- filtered_data %>%\n  group_by(commute_category) %>%\n  summarize(n = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  mutate(percentage = round((n / sum(n)) * 100, 2))\n\n# Create a data frame for summary statistics\nsummary_stats <- data.frame(\n  Category = c(\"Full Sample\", \"Non-commuter\", \"Short Distance\", \"Medium Distance\", \"Long Distance\"),\n  Mean = c(full_sample[\"Mean\"], non_commuter[\"Mean\"], short_distance[\"Mean\"], medium_distance[\"Mean\"], long_distance[\"Mean\"]),\n  SD = c(full_sample[\"SD\"], non_commuter[\"SD\"], short_distance[\"SD\"], medium_distance[\"SD\"], long_distance[\"SD\"]),\n  Min = c(full_sample[\"Min\"], non_commuter[\"Min\"], short_distance[\"Min\"], medium_distance[\"Min\"], long_distance[\"Min\"]),\n  Max = c(full_sample[\"Max\"], non_commuter[\"Max\"], short_distance[\"Max\"], medium_distance[\"Max\"], long_distance[\"Max\"]),\n  Count = c(full_sample_count, \n            number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Non-commuter\") %>% pull(n),\n            number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Short Distance\") %>% pull(n),\n            number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Medium Distance\") %>% pull(n),\n            number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Long Distance\") %>% pull(n)),  \n  Percentage = c(full_sample_percentage, \n                 number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Non-commuter\") %>% pull(percentage),\n                 number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Short Distance\") %>% pull(percentage),\n                 number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Medium Distance\") %>% pull(percentage),\n                 number_commuter %>% filter(commute_category == \"Long Distance\") %>% pull(percentage)))\n\n# Create the table using gt\ntable_gt <- summary_stats %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  tab_header(title = \"Table 5.

Table 4 compares the average number of sick days across different commuter categories and does not show significant differences between them. However, high standard deviations across all categories indicate a wide range of commute distances within each group.\n\n```{r descriptive analysis 2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# gender difference in commute distance and sick days\ngender_labels <- c(\n  \"1\" = \"Male\",\n  \"2\" = \"Female\")\n\n# Apply the mapping\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(gender_label = factor(gender, levels = names(gender_labels), labels = gender_labels), na.rm = TRUE) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(gender_label))\n\n# commute distance histogram\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = commute_km, fill = gender_label)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.8, color = \"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Graph 5.

These findings align with the results from @chidambaram_work-trip_2021, which explain that men are more likely to drive for longer commutes. In contrast, women often engage in trip chaining (combining multiple trips) due to childcare responsibilities, which can affect their overall commuting behavior.\n\n```{r descriptive analysis 3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# sick days histogram\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(sick_days_PY, fill = gender_label)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.7, color = \"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Graph 6.

This is interesting because many studies show that women generally have higher rates of sickness absence compared to men. For instance, a study by @gimenez-nadal_commuting_2022 found that using data from2011 to 2017, a 1% increase in workers' daily commute correlates with an increase in annual sickness absence of 0.018% for male workers and 0.027% for female workers.\n\n```{r descriptive analysis 6, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = factor(health_state), y = commute_km)) +\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"#f9918a\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 7. Commute Distance by Health Status\",\n       x = \"Health Status\", \n       y = \"Commute Distance (km)\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100))\n```\nGraph 7 demonstrates significant variability in commute distances, particularly among individuals categorized under \"very good\" and \"satisfactory\" health states. This suggests that people within these health categories may have diverse commuting behaviors or requirements. Interestingly, individuals who self-report as being in a \"bad\" health state tend to commute shorter distances. This observation could suggest a case of reverse causation, where long commutes do not necessarily deteriorate health; rather, those with poorer health may choose, or be forced, to undertake shorter commutes (@raza_commuting_2021).\n\n```{r descriptive analysis 4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# commuter type by employment status\n# giving English labels as the original is in German\nemployment_status_labels <- c(\n  \"1\" = \"Full-time\",\n  \"2\" = \"Part-time\",\n  \"3\" = \"Ausbildung\",\n  \"4\" = \"Low-income earner\",\n  \"8\" = \"Workshop for handicapped\")\n\n# Apply the mapping\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(employment_status = factor(employment_status, levels = names(employment_status_labels), labels = employment_status_labels))\n\nsummarized_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  group_by(commute_category, employment_status) %>%\n  summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\nggplot(summarized_data, aes(x = employment_status, y = count, fill = commute_category)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Graph 8.

In contrast, low-income earners and individuals undergoing Ausbildung typically commute less than 25 km. According to Goerke and Lorenz (2017), this may be because full-time employees are more likely to be compensated for long commutes, making the trade-off between private time and commuting more acceptable. \n\n```{r descriptive analysis 5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# income and commuter type correlation: weak postive at cor = 0.19\ncor_km_income <- cor(filtered_data$commute_km, filtered_data$income, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = commute_km, y = income)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#f9918a\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", span = 0.8, se = FALSE, color = \"#32b6b8\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Graph 9.

However, commuting distances up to an average of 100 km are generally associated with higher correlation. Beyond this distance, income tends to decline as the distance increases.\n\nIn our data, the average commuting trip length did not see a significant increase between 2015 and 2019. The average one-way commuting distance of workers is `r round(mean(filtered_data$commute_km), 2)` kilometres. This is in line with a range of other studies employing German data (@hedemann_further_nodate). Hence, our sample selection is likely unrelated to commuting behaviour.\n\n## Mixed Effects Analysis\n\nIn this  analysis, I used a statistical technique a linear mixed model to explore how different factors affect the number of sick days people take from work. This model helps to consider both individual differences and overall trends. I included variables such as commute distance, income, age, job changes, and whether individuals work full-time. I also accounted for changes over time by incorporating the year into the model. To ensure our results were accurate, I standardized these factors, which means I compared them on a common scale. This approach allowed me to understand how each factor, like a longer commute or higher income, influences sick days while also accounting for variations among different people. The main health variable is sickness absence days (Model1), but also to compare I included Self-reported Health State (Model2) in the analysis.\n\n```{r model fitting, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n#Creating dummy variable for job change\nfiltered_data$job_change <- as.numeric(filtered_data$job_change)\n\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(job_change_dummy = ifelse(job_change == 1, 1, 0),\n         gender_dummy = ifelse(gender_label == \"Male\", 1, 0),\n         full_time_dummy = ifelse(employment_status == \"Full-time\", 1, 0))\n\n# linear mixed-effects models fitting \n# Prepare the data by scaling the continues variables\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    commute_km_z = scale(commute_km),\n    age_z = scale(age),\n    income_z = scale(income),\n    syear_z = scale(syear))\n\n# Model 1: Number of Days Off Work\nmodel1 <- lmer(sick_days_PY ~ commute_km_z + gender_dummy + age_z + income_z + \n               job_change_dummy + full_time_dummy + syear_z + (1|pid), \n               data = filtered_data)\n\n\n# Model 2: Current Health State\nmodel2 <- lmer(health_state ~ commute_km_z + gender_dummy + age_z + income_z + \n               job_change_dummy + full_time_dummy + syear_z + (1|pid), \n               data = filtered_data)\n\n# Check summaries\nsummary(model1)\nsummary(model2)\n\n```\n\nBoth models analyze data from 11,495 observations across 6,649 unique individuals. The variables were standardized to ensure they are on a common scale for analysis. To interpret the results in the context of the original data, the effects are expressed in terms of standard deviations of the variables. The key findings are as follows:\n\n- The much larger random effects in Model 1 suggest that sickness absence varies more between and within individuals compared to self-reported health state.\n\n- Longer commutes are associated with slightly more sick days, every 17 km increase in distance associated with 2.7 more sick days but have minimal impact on self-reported health. However the findings are statistically not significant.\n\n- Gender has a small negative effect on sick days (males taking fewer sick days (0.3) than women) but negligible effect on self-reported health.\n\n- Age is positively associated with both more sick days (every 11 years increase in age associated with people take about 7.4 more sick days) and worse self-reported health, with a stronger relative effect on health status.\n\n- Higher income is associated with fewer sick days and better self-reported health. The effect is relatively strong in both models.\n\n- Job change is associated with fewer sick days but has minimal impact on self-reported health.\n\n- Full-time employment is strongly associated with more sick days (1.49 more sick days than other groups) but has negligible impact on self-reported health.\n\n- There's a trend of increasing sick days (0.8 days every 1.6 years) over time, but minimal change in self-reported health status.\n\n- The models show different sensitivity to predictors, with sickness absence (Model 1) being more responsive to work-related factors (full-time status, job change) compared to self-reported health status (Model 2).\n\n```{r model result, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n# tidying model result\nfixed_effects1 <- tidy(model1, effects = \"fixed\")\nfixed_effects2 <- tidy(model2, effects = \"fixed\")\n\n# Creating result table\nsimple_table <- bind_rows(\n  fixed_effects1 %>% mutate(Model = \"Model 1\"),\n  fixed_effects2 %>% mutate(Model = \"Model 2\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Variable = case_when(\n      term == \"commute_km_z\" ~ \"Commute Distance\",\n      term == \"gender_dummy\" ~ \"Gender\",\n      term == \"age_z\" ~ \"Age\",\n      term == \"income_z\" ~ \"Income\",\n      term == \"job_change_dummy\" ~ \"Job Change\",\n      term == \"full_time_dummy\" ~ \"Full-time Status\",\n      term == \"syear_z\" ~ \"Year\",\n      term == \"(Intercept)\" ~ \"Intercept\"),\n    Effect = ifelse(statistic > 1.96 | statistic < -1.96, \n                    ifelse(estimate > 0, \"Increase\", \"Decrease\"), \n                    \"No significant effect\"),\n    Significance = ifelse(abs(statistic) > 3.291, \"***\",\n                   ifelse(abs(statistic) > 2.576, \"**\",\n                   ifelse(abs(statistic) > 1.96, \"*\", \"\"))),\n    `Relative Impact` = abs(estimate) / max(abs(estimate))) %>%\n  select(Model, Variable, Effect, Significance, `Relative Impact`) %>%\n  arrange(Model, desc(`Relative Impact`))\n\n# Display the table\nkable(simple_table, format = \"html\", escape = FALSE, caption = \"Table 7.

However, an analysis using the SOEP data in Germany reveals different findings. This study aimed to extend the analysis of the relationship between commute distance and sickness absence to more recent years (2015-2019) using longitudinal data.\n\nDescriptive analysis confirmed that full-time employees are the primary long- and medium-distance commuters, with their income positively correlating with commute distances up to 100 km. Generally, women tend to have shorter commutes, while men usually take fewer sick days. Although there are no significant differences in sickness absence between commuter types, within-group analysis shows that a higher number of standard deviations in sick days indicates greater variability. Additionally, individuals who rate their health as poorer are more likely to avoid longer commutes.\n\nSickness absence varies significantly between and within individuals, whereas self-reported health state shows less variation. Longer commutes slightly increase sick days (2.7 more for every 17 km), but this effect is statistically insignificant. Gender has a minor effect on sick days, with males taking fewer sick days (0.3 days less than females). Age is associated with more sick days (7.4 more for every 11 years older) and worse self-reported health, with a stronger impact on health status. Higher income correlates with fewer sick days and better self-reported health, showing a strong effect in both models. Full-time employment is linked to significantly more sick days (1.49 more). There is a trend of increasing sick days over time, but self-reported health remains stable. Overall, sickness absence is more sensitive to work-related factors than self-reported health.\n\n# Limitations and Next Steps\nThe study only took account of commute distance as the key dependent variables However the research showing the significant effects of commute mode and travel time (@guo_commuting_2020). Different modes of commuting had varying impacts on emotional wellbeing. For example, walking commuters reported higher life satisfaction compared to car users, while bicycle commuting was positively related to quality of life. Conversely, car commuters experienced lower positive emotions with longer commutes compared to those using public transport or multimodal commuting (@liu_systematic_2022).\n\nAnother limitation of this study is the choice and interpretation of the mixed effects model and its results. Although I compared results from both fixed effects and mixed effects models and found the latter more suitable for unbalanced panel data due to its ability to account for time-invariant variables, unobserved variables and randomness, this was my first experience with mixed effects models on an unbalanced panel. As I am still gaining experience in this area, there may be limitations in my understanding of the possible models and their interpretation. I welcome any suggestions on how I could enhance my approach and address these potential limitations.\n\nBased on the identified limitations, I suggest the following next steps:\n\n- **Include Commute Mode in the Analysis:** Incorporate data on different commute modes to examine how various modes affect both positive and negative outcomes related to sickness absence and self-reported health.\n\n- **Analyze COVID Impact:** Although this study intentionally excluded the effects of COVID, future research could benefit from including data from COVID-affected years. Comparing pre- and post-COVID states could provide valuable insights into how the pandemic has influenced commuting and health outcomes.\n\n- **Address Gaps in Longitudinal Data:** For longitudinal surveys like SOEP with missing years, explore and identify the best methods and models for handling gaps in data to improve the robustness and accuracy of future analyses.\n\n- **Investigate Within-Group Variations:** The data showed significant within-group variations the in key variables. Further analysis is needed to identify the underlying causes of these variations and understand their implications.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Variables of the study\n\n- Commute Distance in kilometers
