Hi! Iâ€™m Udval. My passion for data analysis was ignited during my time at Meta, where I worked extensively with large datasets. Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in International Business Administration with a specialization in Data Science at the University of Viadrina. This program is further developing my technical expertise and equipping me to drive data-driven enhancements in products, strategies, and operations. My interests lie in urban green mobility, transport data analysis, and trust and safety, with a particular focus on financial fraud and scams.

Feel free to explore my work from my current studies and get in touch if you have any questions!
