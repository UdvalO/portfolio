As part of the certified data analyst exam by DataCamp, I completed a two-hour exam testing my R and SQL skills, followed by a four-hour practical exam where I analyzed sales data from a stationary shop using R. You can see full exam submission [here](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/efdedffd-1df1-4b55-be0e-4c7c6ed91eb7).

The goal of the analysis was to determine the best-performing marketing method following the launch of new products. Additionally, I identified high-paying and loyal customers to prioritize them in the marketing strategy for future product launches. The analysis consisted of following steps:

-   Identifying analysis goals

-   Cleaning and validating data

-   Conducting exploratory analysis

-   Identifying key business metrics for future monitoring

-   Recommendation

-   Presenting my findings through 12 minute online video
